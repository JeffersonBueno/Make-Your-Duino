# Make-Your-Duino
This project has the purpose of encouraging and educating the use of electronics carried out by the Jefferson Bueno channel in partnership with the JLCPCB.    A simple but interesting project for you to assemble in your home.

# Supplies
Few components will be used in the complete list and also the gerber file you can find at the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-SQw-m2kRlhmra1sCNcPnA1o4gDNDlSV?usp=sharing

# Assembling the Circuit
Analyzing the operation of an Arduino Uno, I mapped all the pinouts and functions, thus ensuring that the replica has all the features of an Arduino.



After that, I created the electronic diagram to then design the PCB.Analyzing the operation of an Arduino Uno, I mapped all the pinouts and functions, thus ensuring that the replica has all the features of an Arduino.

To make your assembly easier, I looked for components that provide the same function and that are easier to find in the electronic components market.

# PCB Design
After completing the electronic diagram, it was time to design the board.

For this I took all the measurements of an Arduino Uno with its connectors and terminals and also with its holes, ensuring that it stays the same.

# 3D Model
Here in the 3D viewer we can check how our replica of MAKE Duino will look where the result is given to our created design.

# How to Make PCB
The PCB's I sent my GERBER file to JLCPCB which has an excellent finish and extreme quality.

In addition to all the qualities already mentioned, they have a very good price where PBC's with a size of up to 100x100mm you can get the best boards paying $2 for 5 units.

# Final Assembly and Testing
In addition to a simple circuit, its assembly is also.

In order not to have a very long article, I recorded everything on video on my channel.

And even if you don't have the necessary equipment, I showed you that with an iron you can assemble this project and get a professional finish.

# Final Considerations
I hope you liked the project and I would like your comments and if you have assembled this project, let me know about your experience.

You can also follow all projects on my channel.
